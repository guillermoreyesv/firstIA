# Inches to Centimeters Converter

This Python project uses neural networks to convert inches to centimeters. It requires TensorFlow and NumPy to be installed.

## How to Run

To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:
```console
py main.py
```

## Model Training and Reuse

Once the neural network has been trained, the model is saved and can be reused in future executions of the program.
